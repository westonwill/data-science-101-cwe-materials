# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Class/Workshop: Tools & Policies

This course teaches students about ____. This field is constantly evolving, and it would be impossible to introduce every tool in one workshop.

Instead, General Assembly provides a core set of objectives for this workshop, along with guidelines for how to ensure students reach these objectives. As an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to adapt these recommendations to your local context and modify/expand on any of these tools as you see fit.


## Required Tools

- [Github](www.github.com) - We’re using Github to store and share our code
- X
- Y

#### Optional Tools
These tools aren't required, but offer additional functionality that students may find helpful!

- Popular Text Editors: [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)



## Technology Policy

General Assembly introduces students to concepts using the environment, tools, and ethics of the open-source community. We try to only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.

#### Laptop Policy

We strongly suggest that everyone use Mac laptops, as most instructors will perform examples in (and use) Mac OS every day. In general, instructors will only be able to provide tech support for students with Macs. Please see our OS Policy below for further details.  

It is also our experience that students should have laptops with screens of at least 13-inches. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.


#### Operating Systems Policy

**Mac:** We require students using Mac laptops to be able to run at least Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or greater. *This rules out some older MacBooks*

**PC/Linux:** Students are welcome to bring their own PC or Linux machines, but once again, we **cannot guarantee* tech support for these devices.**


#### Questions? Issues?

1. If you see elements you would like to add, improve, or change, please feel free to submit a **pull request** with your modifications! A member of our instructional team will make sure to review and merge applicable changes.

2. If you see bugs, typos, or other elements that need flagging, please file a **Github Issue**. A member of our instructional team will be sure to review and prioritize as needed.

3. If you encounter any other problems not mentioned here, please submit a ticket to our [GA Helpdesk]()
